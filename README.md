# Stock-Market-Analysis
This project is basically done in python using ML Algorithms the project consist of mainly analyzing different stock market prediction algorithms


This Project is also keeping an eye on the behaviour of large and small dataset on diffrent algorithms


the dataset consist of 
Large dataset  - AXISBANK__EQ__NSE__NSE__MINUTE.csv
                it is the opening and closing price of axis bank.
Small Dataset -  AMFI.csv, BSEN.csv
                it is the opening and closing price of SBI mutual Fund
                and Bombay Stock Exchange Data of opening price and closing price
                
               
The Algorithms that are used here are - 

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression 
2. Linear SVR Method
3. K Nearest Neighbours
4. Decision Tree Regressor
5. Linear Regression
6. Moving Average


We comapre the acurracy of prediction by each algorith and we find out "Moving Average " perform best among all algorithm and on both large and small dataset.
